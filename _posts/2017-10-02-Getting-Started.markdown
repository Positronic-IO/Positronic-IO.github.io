The best source of inspiration are success stories. Seek out and read as many case studies as you can get your hands on. Attend meetups to connect with peers to hear their stories. The more success stories you consume, the more you training data you provide to the neural network in your brain to help classify and predict the sorts of problems that make good candidates for AI. Once you’ve trained your internal neural network you’re ready to apply it to your own business.

At Positronic we take a four-stage approach to implementing a new data science project.

First, we go through a DISCOVER process where we visually navigate the available data looking for patterns and correlations and we apply advanced analytics and visualizations as a guide to building hypotheses for what sorts of predictive models may fall out of the data. Second, we test chosen hypothesis through TEST. A test is a unitary data research project over a big data collection. Often data cleanup and augmentation is required to piece together a viable dataset for learning. The test process explores all relevant machine learning models to generate mathematical proof of efficacy. Third, we BUILD an API from a model with proven efficacy and refine it with further training until the model achieves the desired level of accuracy and performance on new unseen data. Finally, our cloud apps team partners with your engineering and IT teams to DEPLOY the new interfaces into an existing line of business app or a new cloud app.
