The Oscar W. Larson Company is a third-generation family-owned business that 
provides maintenance and repair for point-of-sales systems and fuel dispensers 
at gas stations. Truck re-rolls are big problem for Larson. A truck re-roll is 
the term for when a truck must make multiple trips to a gas station because the 
technician didn’t have the right tools for the job. It’s same for me every time 
I tackle a simple home plumbing repair. I can’t make just one trip to the hardware 
store. Larson worked with external partners, an external consultant and Google, 
to build a machine learning system to manage the inventory that technicians take 
with them. With this new AI-powered system in place, truck re-rolls went down by 
20 percent while simultaneously reducing the inventory levels on trucks by up to 
35 percent.
